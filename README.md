# filter-object-of-objects
Sometimes what if you received an object of objects rather than array of objects from backend as a response, so how you will render that object of objects data using iterator of loop ?  Solution Finally, with ES2017, it's official now! We have 3 variations to convert an Object to an Array 🎊  The array has an array of methods (sorry, bad pun 😝). So by converting the object into an array, you have access to all of that. Woohoo 🥳
